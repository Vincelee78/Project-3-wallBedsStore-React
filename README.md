## TCG-Project-3-React-Space Saving Furniture Systems
The name of this project is called React-Space Saving Furniture Systems and is an eCommerce platform for selling space-saving wall beds. The project is aimed at home owners, backbacker hotels, student domoritories, office owners who have a relatively small place or users who want more space in their rooms. This will solve these consumer needs by also freeing up more space in their bedrooms or study rooms so that they have place for more items in their rooms or to allow for better cleaning and maintenance of their rooms.

## My goal/motivation for creating this project:
I have observed how small and compact flats are here.  Built-to-order (BTO) flats are getting more compact with each project. Thus, the need for effective usage of space is in demand. People are finding ways to minimize space usage when in reality, the solution is to maximize what you have. How? By introducing space saving furniture to users to purchase.

## Context: 
Space-saving furniture is designed to make full use of limited spaces by incorporating folding mechanisms to keep furniture such as bed in stowed position when not in use. The space saving beds can also be designed to add on other furniture function such as desk or sitting sofa to form a multi-functional furniture system. The site provides users the option to purchase these beds as well as dual and multi-functional wall beds with desk or sofa, bunk beds, and many more. This concept allows users to maximize the space they already have without the worry of purchasing separate bulky furniture, shelves, or tables and taking up a lot of space.
Current and future homeowners should consider purchasing space-saving furniture as a cost-effective method and an efficient way to maximize their living space.

## <a name="a">1. Project Design </a>
There are two parts to this project. The front-end of this project is done with React.js and the back-end of this project is done with Node.js, mySQL database and Express.js for which the code can be found [here.](https://github.com/Vincelee78/Project-3-Express-mySQL)

The schema diagram for mySQL database can be found [here.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dtrwtlldr/image/upload/v1639099995/mySQL_relationship_final_tq5zw7.jpg)


### Functional requirements:
#### Features: 
There are different categories of wall beds the user can click on and check the description, the photos, the dimensions of the wall bed according to the mattress size, the materials the bed is made from and their prices.
There is an add to cart option for users to purchase the wall bed they want. They also can pay by credit card to checkout their cart items.
Content: Each category of wall bed has a brief description and their key features, the delivery information and the price for each wall bed according to mattress size.
Non-functional requirements:

 ## <a name="e">5. Design</a>
### 5.1 UI/UX
The UI/UX design for this project was catered for the ease of use for the user. The design process for the website are as follows:

### 5.1.1 User Interface
#### Structure:
The organization of the site content will contain the landing page with the navigation bar and site’s logo on the top. The landing page will show the hero image of the open and closed image of a featured wall bed, and clicking on 'shop all beds' will bring the user to another page where it show the different wall bed categories and their respective images. In this page, filtering the wall beds is possible using a search feature. Clicking on the wall beds' categories will show their respective options, their description and the add to cart feature.
* The total unit price and subtotal will be shown when the user selects the wall bed he/she wants to purchase. This website caters to the local residents in Singapore so there are no additional shipping costs as it is included in the unit cost price.
*	Refund is allowed when the furniture arrives in a damaged condition. User has 3 days to file a claim after they receive the bed and provide photo evidence under at the bottom of the landing page where our contact details, location and email can be found.
*	The database will store the user's shipping and order details and will be shown in their user account in the front end.
*	The order status will also be shown in the user account.

### Skeleton:
#### Layout:
*	The user login, logout and register is at the top right of the screen for easy reference.
*	Checking out button will be done in the shopping cart. It is located on the top right of the navigation bar where it can be seen easily as a blue shopping cart icon. Total and subtotal price will be shown in the shopping cart, including shipping.
*	Search function will be in the catalogue page of the site with the image and name of the wall beds.
*	In the navigation bar at the top, will be home, catalogue, about and account pages. Within the 'home' option of the navigation bar, it will have a dropdown bar consisting of the 'home page' and 'directions' option. Clicking on the 'directions' option will open a map showing the marker with the location of our showroom and an marker of the nearest MRT station to our showroom.
*	The company logo is at the left of the navigation bar at the top.

### Surface:
#### Colours:
White background with black and dark brown fonts in the landing page for better contrast and easy visualization. 
Usage of [coolors](https://coolors.co/) to select my colour scheme.
Images used will not be too bright colours as I am using a white background.
Usage of traditional fonts such as 'Stencil Std, Fantasy' and 'Times New Roman, Times, serif'.
Adequate white spaces between characters and lines in description for easy reading.


#### 5.2.2 User Experience:
Although the website makes prolific use of tables in the backend , most components except the tables are mobile-friendly. The frontend react features are mobile responsive. The backend express.js uses tailwindcss to create a responsive design. The default tailwind font family can be found in the documentation [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-family)
