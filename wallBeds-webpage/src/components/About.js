                            Space-saving furniture is designed to make full use of limited spaces by incorporating multiple furniture into one or adding new and unique functions. They are often associated with minimalistic and hidden furniture.
                            Examples include Wall Beds, also known as Murphy Beds, Multifunctional Tables where it functions as a coffee and a dining table, Extendable Table, Bunk Beds, and many more. This concept allows users to maximize the
                            space they already have without the worry of purchasing separate bulky beds, shelves, or tables and taking up a lot of space.
                            Current and future homeowners should consider switching to space-saving furniture as a cost-effective method and an efficient way to maximize their living space.
